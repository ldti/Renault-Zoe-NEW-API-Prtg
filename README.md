# Renault-Zoe-NEW-API-Prtg

Custom PRTG Python script for monitoring your Renault ZOE. \
Based on the work from here : https://github.com/jamesremuscat/pyze, with a simple PRTG wrapper for JSON results. \
Don't forget to `"C:\Program Files (x86)\PRTG Network Monitor\python\Scripts\pip.exe" install pyze` beforehand. \
\
\
outputs basic information like battery status, range, plugged in status and charging status. \
DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE YOUR CREDENTIALS BEFORE RUNNING. \
Gigya and Kamereon API keys are the same for all Renault, no need to touch them.
